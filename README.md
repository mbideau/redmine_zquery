# redmine_zquery
Redmine plugin that allows using simple OR between query filters


## Licence and History
The files in this repository were imported from a Redmine plugin made by Quan VN _(without its permission, because I've not managed to contact him)_.  
Link to the original source code distributed in a ZIP file : http://www.redmine.org/plugins/boolean_query  
The name of the plugin was : _zquery_, then _\_query_ (to be loaded first), then _boolean query_ (as on the plugin page in redmine.org).


## Installation
Get the sources and put them into a directory named _query in the Redmine plugins directory :

	git clone https://github.com/mbideau/redmine_zquery.git plugins/_query


## Documentation
This plugin allows a simple use of OR operator in query.

This plugin adds three new filters, acting as markers: All follow (OR), Any follow (AND), Any follow (OR)
Here is how it works

1. All the filters to be ANDed (if any) should come first. They will be joined with AND as usual. Lets call it A part, A can be empty
2. Then comes one of the Marker filters: All follow (OR), Any follow (AND), Any follow (OR), lets call it M
3. Then come other filters for example f1, f2, f3

The result will be 

	A. If M is: All follow (OR) is Yes =>  (A) OR (f1 AND f2 AND f3)
				All follow (OR) is not Yes =>  (A) OR NOT (f1 AND f2 AND f3)
	B. If M is: Any follow (AND) is Yes => (A) AND (f1 OR f2 OR f3)
				Any follow (AND) is not Yes => (A) AND NOT (f1 OR f2 OR f3)
	C. If M is: Any follow (OR) is Yes =>  (A) OR (f1 OR f2 OR f3)
				Any follow (OR) is not Yes =>  (A) OR NOT (f1 OR f2 OR f3)

Notes:

1. It is possible to user more than one Marker in the query. What the term "follow" means is all the filters below till another marker or end.
2. This plugin is tested in Redmine 2.6.5, ruby 2, rails 3.2.2. By examining the code of statement method, I guest that it will work for 2.6.x, 3.0.3 (they all have the same statement method)

3. To help debug, I log the result of the statement method (with prefix STATEMENT) into log file at info level . You can exam this log to see if it works correctly
